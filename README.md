# Sports Day Management System
A simple sports day management system, for schools/places who use FileMaker.


Developed in 2012, through to 2014, the system is based off the idea that every 'student' has a User ID, and it is easier to record this, than a full name / year / class.

There is cabailities for Prelims / Heats / Event Groups / Events / House Points / Reports / Multiple Users / Championship Points.


**Important**: This project is no longer maintained, and will need to be adjusted to suit your needs.  Some things in it don't work very well, others do.

FileMaker and Git don't go together amazingly, but it is a good place to share it for others to use.



This project was developed for New Zealand Schools, and KAMAR schools.
